# IMDB-Exploratory-Analysis
Exploring IMDB dataset using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib

# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis.

What do I need to install?
To follow along you will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. 

# Why this Project?
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and show how everything fits together. 

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!


# What  I learned From This Project?

After completing this project, I learned:

* All the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* How to pose questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* How to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that is useful
* How to communicate the results of my analysis
* How to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* How to use pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
* How to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
